Piper
=====

GTK application to configure gaming mice. Piper uses libratbag via ratbagd.

Dependencies
============

Piper uses the ratbagd Python bindings. It doesn't require ratbagd itself to
be running, but well, it'll be a little useless without ratbagd.

Contributing
============

Yes please. As you can see, years of design experience have gone into the
user interface and it is clearly the pinnacle of what is possible.
Feel free to send patches or pull requests or submit improvements for
the general design of the app.

Note that the devices displayed by Piper come from libratbag.
